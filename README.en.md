> Turn a job description into a project, a project into a resume, and a resume into interviews.

Welcome to the Shushu Internship & Employment QQ group: **976187338**.

SIT, short for **shushu internship tool**, is an AI-assisted internship project preparation toolkit. It turns a target JD, meaning **Job Description** or job posting, into a practical project package that you can use for applications, interviews, code walkthroughs, and presentation materials.

A JD usually contains role responsibilities, required skills, tech stacks, business context, location, degree or graduation-year constraints, and other hiring requirements.

The toolkit is designed for computer-industry internship candidates across backend, frontend, full-stack, mobile, test development, data engineering, cloud/DevOps, security, systems, AI, and algorithm roles. It is especially useful for beginners or low-experience candidates who need a fast path from role targeting to project selection, code understanding, project modification, resume writing, and interview drilling.

If you only provide a JD, the workflow first asks a short intake: your current level, preferred tech stack, time budget, available resources, and whether you want to fully run the project.

## What It Does

- Finds 2-3 suitable GitHub projects based on a target JD, then ranks them by role fit, ramp-up speed, interview value, run cost, and modification potential.
- Audits a cloned project and generates `audit.json`, `overview.md`, and `overview.html` to help you understand structure, entry points, dependencies, APIs, UI flows, data flows, and task flows.
- Plans a baseline run path: start with the smallest local run, then move to cloud servers, databases, object storage, GPU/AutoDL, or other remote environments if needed.
- Suggests interview-ready modifications, such as adding APIs, pages, databases, cache, tests, monitoring, CI/CD, data flows, performance optimization, demos, or AI/algorithm experiments.
- Generates an interview pack: STAR resume bullets, core code walkthrough notes, interviewer-style Q&A, PPT prompts, and an application checklist.

## Recommended Usage

Send your target JD and personal background to an AI assistant, then choose a run depth:

```text
Use shushu internship tool to help me turn the following JD into a computer-industry internship project that I can apply with, explain in interviews, and present clearly.

My background:
- Current level:
- Familiar languages/frameworks:
- Time budget:
- Local/remote resources:
- Desired run depth: interview-only / smoke-test / local-full-run / remote-full-run

JD (Job Description / job posting):
...
```

If you are not sure how to fill in the background section, you can provide only the JD and let the workflow ask follow-up questions.

## Install Local Scripts

```bash
cd shushu-internship-tool
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Scripts

Audit a local project:

```bash
python -m shushu_internship_tool.repo_audit --repo /path/to/repo --out reports/audit --name my-project
```

Rank candidate projects:

```bash
python -m shushu_internship_tool.candidate_score --jd jd.txt --candidates candidates.json --out reports/ranking
```

Create an interview-pack skeleton:

```bash
python -m shushu_internship_tool.interview_pack --project-notes reports/audit --out reports/interview-pack
```

After installation, you can also use the command-line entry points:

```bash
shushu-repo-audit --repo /path/to/repo --out reports/audit --name my-project
shushu-candidate-score --jd jd.txt --candidates candidates.json --out reports/ranking
shushu-interview-pack --project-notes reports/audit --out reports/interview-pack
```

## Candidate JSON Example

```json

  {
    "name": "tiny-ticket-system",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/example/tiny-ticket-system",
    "license": "MIT",

    "last_commit": "2026-04-20",
    "tags": ["fastapi", "postgresql", "docker", "rest-api"],
    "jd_keywords": ["backend", "api design", "database", "docker"],
    "matched_jd_terms": ["backend development", "API design", "database", "containerized deployment"],
    "runnable": true,
    "compute": "local_docker",
    "mod_ideas": ["add JWT auth", "add Redis cache", "add integration tests"],
    "risk_notes": ["database migration needs setup"]
  }
]
```

## Job-Search Efficiency Principles

- The first goal is to help candidates get interviews quickly: project title, JD fit, concise resume bullets, and interview Q&A come first.
- Do not spend all your time fully reproducing paper-level results or rewriting an entire system. Start with a smoke test, understand the core flow, and prepare a demo or modification that you can explain clearly.
- Keep modifications focused and interview-friendly. Prioritize small but useful increments that can move fast, such as APIs, pages, tests, cache, deployment, performance, data processing, or algorithm experiments.
- If you have metrics, write concrete numbers. If you do not, describe engineering output, method understanding, system design, experiment design, and next steps.
- Interview preparation matters more than perfect experiments: let an AI assistant repeatedly question you until you can explain input/output, design choices, failure reasons, and improvement directions.

## Run Depth

- `interview-only`: Do not fully run the project. Focus on project selection, resume bullets, core-code reading path, interview Q&A, and PPT prompts.
- `smoke-test`: Run the smallest possible path to prove the project starts or the core flow works.
- `local-full-run`: Run the full baseline/demo locally and produce presentable output where possible.
- `remote-full-run`: Use cloud servers, databases, GPUs, or other remote resources for a full run when time and budget allow.

## Development

```bash
cd shushu-internship-tool
